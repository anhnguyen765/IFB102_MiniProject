## Project Objectives
This project sets out to achieve the integration of face recognition technology with a password generator and management application, using Python as the programming language and Raspberry Pi 400. The project presents a unique opportunity to enhance user authentication, convenience, and security. 

With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms, facial authentication provides a convenient and highly secured method for users to enhance their security for sensitive data. In addition, the password manager application also elevates the convenience of users by providing a system that generates unique passwords which cannot easily be hacked and stores the password so that users do not need to remember every single password. 

Raspberry Pi 400 is a compact personal computer with built-in keyboard and integrated components, making it convenient and easy to set up and use. With its powerful ARM-based processor, Raspberry Pi 400 has the capability to handle complex algorithm and computations involved in face recognition tasks.

In short, the project aims to achieve a secure, user-friendly, and efficient solution that simplifies password management and provides well-protected authentication through facial recognition. 

This is an Assessment Task for IFB102 - Introduction to Computer System at QUT. The project is scored 24/25.
